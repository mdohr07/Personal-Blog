Draft Today I want to write about friendship. The inspiration for this is that one friendship that I have lost not too long ago as well as having to socialise a lot lately and my experience with it.
Let’s go way back first. From what my mom told me, I was very outgoing when I was little, talking to all the strangers. Well, little did I know how people could be, right? When I started going to school I figured out that not everyone was nice and friendly and that there were (or rather are) people who don’t like me and that they can be pretty mean and even cruel, regardless of whether they like me or not. What that did to me was, that I became pretty introverted and fast forward to adulthood even isolated. Also, I always had few friends throughout my life.
Now, that sounds kind of tragic, but actually having few friends never bothered me much. I am very comfortable spending time alone and I can entertain myself easily. I also like being alone but in company, for example going to a cafe alone and be surrounded by strangers that I am not taking to.
During a most of that time though - and I mean almost thirty years - I had this one friend who was just part of my life. She was my best friend for a long time, but things got weird at some point and our friendship ended.
Several years passed and that friend and I made contact again and after careful first steps we renewed our friendship.
Things had changed a lot, because we had changed.
