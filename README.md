# Personal Frontend Development Blog

This is a personal blog focused on frontend development, written in German. It's a fork of an existing repository that already had a layout that suited my preferences. I made cosmetic and functional changes to adapt it to my needs.

## Cosmetic Changes üíÑ
- Customized cards.
- Removed images - no GIFs in the header, no preview images for blog posts as I don't plan to use many images in my blog posts.
- Made other visual adjustments, including fonts and colors, with a new look following a 4-color system inspired by Gameboy Color.
- The dark theme is the only theme available.

## Functional Changes ‚öôÔ∏è
- Added dynamic routing for categories (work in progress).
- Added dynamic routing for blog posts.
- Blog posts are structured with Markdown layouts and Frontmatter.

## Future Plans üìù
I'm currently working on:
- Improving categories and tags.
- Creating a customized 404 page.
- Adding pagination.
- Implementing a sitemap.
- Adding an RSS feature.
